# Advanced Time Series Forecasting Project

This project implements an end-to-end advanced time series analysis and forecasting pipeline using Python. It includes data preprocessing, visualization, ARIMA-based modeling, evaluation metrics, and result persistence.

## Project Pipeline
1. Data ingestion and cleaning
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
3. Stationarity testing
4. Model training (ARIMA/SARIMA)
5. Forecasting
6. Performance evaluation (RMSE, MSE)
7. Result export

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Scikit-learn
- Statsmodels

## Installation
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
