Title: Advanced Time Series Forecasting with Deep Learning and Attention

1. Introduction
This project implements and compares a baseline LSTM model with an attention-based Transformer model for multivariate time series forecasting.

2. Dataset
A synthetic multivariate dataset with 5000 samples and 3 features was generated using trend, seasonality, and Gaussian noise.

3. Models
Baseline Model: LSTM neural network.
Advanced Model: Transformer-inspired attention model using MultiHeadAttention.

4. Hyperparameters
Sequence Length: 30
Epochs: 10
Batch Size: 32
Optimizer: Adam
Attention Heads: 2

5. Results
The following metrics were used for evaluation: MAE and RMSE.
